# Symfony Bicycle Project

There's only a few steps to run this example. I tested it using Linux. Unfortunately I don't have a Mac to test it, so just a heads up. I built this using the latest PHP version so there's a little syntatic sugar here and there.

1. After cloning the repo, you can use `docker compose up`
2. Add `127.0.0.1 bicycle.localhost` to `/etc/hosts` to your host PC.
3. Visit three working examples:
    - http://bicycle.localhost:9090/api/bicycleloggingexample?direction=forward&steering=left
    - http://bicycle.localhost:9090/api/bicyclefactoryexample?direction=forward&steering=left
    - http://bicycle.localhost:9090/api/bicycle?direction=forward&steering=left

Valid values for `steering` in the url is `right`, `left`, `straight`

Valid values for `direction` in the url is `forward` and `backwards`

Any other words will log and trigger (caught) exceptions for the purpose of this excercise. Invalid words will also be displayed in the docker terminal logs.

You'll see something like: `NOTICE: PHP message: [error] There are only two directions to move a bicycle! Forward and backwards.` ...

To keep the exercise simple there is no validation of null or empty values so those will definitely return a 500 error.

That's it. Thank you for taking a look at the code guys

## Troubleshooting


If for whatever reason `composer install` fails during `docker compose up`, in the project folder run `docker compose exec -it php bash`. Then run `cd ./bicycle && composer install`.

That should get the dependencies working.
